## Typing Test

**Project description:** a simple typing speed test application using Python for backend logic and Tkinter for the user interface. The program tracks typing accuracy and calculates words per minute in real-time. It features a clean, responsive GUI with start/reset functionality and dynamic text prompts. This project demonstrates my ability to combine logic with GUI design using core Python libraries.

**Goal:** Build a website that measures typing speed and accuracy, while showcasing skills in Python programming and GUI development with Tkinter.

**Result:** Successfully developed a functional and user-friendly typing test that calculates real-time performance metrics. This demonstrates my ability to implement event-driven programming.
