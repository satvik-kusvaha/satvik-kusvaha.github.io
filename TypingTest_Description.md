**Project description:** a simple typing speed test application using Python for backend logic and Tkinter for the user interface. The program tracks typing accuracy and calculates words per minute in real-time. It features a clean, responsive GUI with start/reset functionality and dynamic text prompts. This project demonstrates my ability to combine logic with GUI design using core Python libraries.
