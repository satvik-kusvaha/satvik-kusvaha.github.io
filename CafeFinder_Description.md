## Cafe Finder

**Project description:** A Cafe Finder website that showcases my HTML and JavaScript skills, along with Flask for backend data handling. The site allows users to explore cafes across London and apply filters based on their preferences, such as Wi-Fi availability, seating, and more. Each cafe listing is interactiveâ€”clicking on a cafe reveals detailed information including its location and features. The user interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy to navigate and find the perfect spot. This project demonstrates my ability to build functional, data-driven web applications with a strong user experience focus.
